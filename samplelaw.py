# Predefined dictionary of scenario-based legal summaries
qa_data = {
    "speeding": "Under the Motor Vehicles Act, speeding is punishable with a fine ranging from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 2000. Repeat offenses can lead to increased penalties or even suspension of the license. Always adhere to speed limits to avoid accidents and fines.",
    "accident ":"In the event of a car accident, especially if it involves injury or damage, you may be liable under the Motor Vehicles Act.Operating a vehicle negligently can lead to penalties. Serious accidents may also involve imprisonment or fines.Depending on the severity, fines may range from ‚Çπ2,000 to ‚Çπ10,000, and/or imprisonment.",
    "parking": "Parking laws vary by region, but generally, improper parking in a residential or restricted area can lead to fines. Many local authorities impose fines up to Rs. 500 for first-time violations, while repeated offenses can lead to higher fines or vehicle towing.",
    " Hack" :"Hacking into a website without permission, even if you didn‚Äôt intend to cause harm, is still a violation under the Information Technology (IT) Act. Unauthorized access to someone else‚Äôs system or data is punishable under Section 66 of the IT Act, which can lead to imprisonment for up to 3 years and/or a fine of up to ‚Çπ5 lakh. You may be prosecuted even if there was no intention to harm, as the law focuses on the act of unauthorized access itself.",
    "license": "Driving without a valid license is a serious offense under the Motor Vehicles Act. Fines may start from Rs. 5000, and repeat offenses can lead to imprisonment of up to 3 months or more severe penalties, depending on the jurisdiction.",
    "helmet": "According to the Motor Vehicles Act, riding without a helmet is a punishable offense, typically with a fine of Rs. 1000. Even if you were unaware that helmet use was mandatory in your state, it is unlikely that this will serve as a valid excuse. Compliance with the law is expected, and you may have to pay the fine. In some cases, you might be able to request a hearing to explain the situation, but the law generally requires helmet use for safety..",
    "stolen ": "If your vehicle is stolen, the first step is to file a First Information Report (FIR) at the nearest police station, providing details like the vehicle's make, model, registration number, and insurance papers. The police will investigate the theft, and the FIR serves as an official record. This report is also crucial for filing an insurance claim, as it may be required for reimbursement or compensation. Stay in touch with both the police and your insurance company for updates and to ensure the necessary documentation is provided..",
    "Speeding in School Zone":"Exceeding the speed limit in a school zone can result in a higher fine due to the increased safety risks for children. Speed limits in school zones are generally lower, and being unaware of this won't usually be accepted as a valid reason for avoiding the fine. You can request a hearing or appeal if you believe it was an honest mistake."

# Case details and arguments
case_summary = """
The case of *Jageshwar Prasad Namdeo vs. Smt. Kalpana Pathak* involves a dispute under the Motor Vehicles Act. 
The appeal was filed by Jageshwar Prasad Namdeo, who challenged an award by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Satna. 
This arose from a motorcycle accident in which Omkar Pathak, the deceased, was riding as a pillion passenger on Jageshwar Prasad Namdeo‚Äôs motorcycle. 
Due to alleged negligent driving by Namdeo, the motorcycle slipped, leading to serious injuries for Pathak, who later died. 
Pathak‚Äôs family filed a claim, arguing that Namdeo's rash driving caused the accident, while Namdeo argued he was the pillion rider and contested jurisdiction.
"""

arguments = [
    ("Jurisdiction - Appellant‚Äôs Lawyer", 
     "Your Honor, the primary issue here is jurisdiction. The accident took place in Panna, and both the appellant and the claimants reside there. According to Section 166(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, the claim must be filed in the jurisdiction where the accident occurred or where the parties reside. The Satna tribunal should not entertain this claim as it lacks jurisdiction."),
    
    ("Jurisdiction - Respondent‚Äôs Lawyer", 
     "Respectfully, Your Honor, while the accident did occur in Panna, the claimant, Mrs. Kalpana Pathak, was living temporarily in Satna at the time of filing. Her son, one of the minor claimants, was studying in Satna, and she was residing there to care for him. Section 166(2) allows for filing where the claimant resides, which includes Satna."),
    ("Negligence and Fault in the Accident-Appellant‚Äôs Lawyer",
     "Your Honor, the deceased, Mr. Omkar Pathak, was driving the motorcycle, and my client, Mr. Namdeo, was merely the pillion passenger. It was the deceased's own negligence that led to the accident, not my client's actions. We urge the court to recognize that the responsibility lies solely with the deceased")
