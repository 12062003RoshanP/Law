# Case details and arguments
case_summary = """
The case of *Jageshwar Prasad Namdeo vs. Smt. Kalpana Pathak* involves a dispute under the Motor Vehicles Act. 
The appeal was filed by Jageshwar Prasad Namdeo, who challenged an award by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Satna. 
This arose from a motorcycle accident in which Omkar Pathak, the deceased, was riding as a pillion passenger on Jageshwar Prasad Namdeo‚Äôs motorcycle. 
Due to alleged negligent driving by Namdeo, the motorcycle slipped, leading to serious injuries for Pathak, who later died. 
Pathak‚Äôs family filed a claim, arguing that Namdeo's rash driving caused the accident, while Namdeo argued he was the pillion rider and contested jurisdiction.
"""

arguments = [
    ("Jurisdiction - Appellant‚Äôs Lawyer", 
     "Your Honor, the primary issue here is jurisdiction. The accident took place in Panna, and both the appellant and the claimants reside there. According to Section 166(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, the claim must be filed in the jurisdiction where the accident occurred or where the parties reside. The Satna tribunal should not entertain this claim as it lacks jurisdiction."),
    
    ("Jurisdiction - Respondent‚Äôs Lawyer", 
     "Respectfully, Your Honor, while the accident did occur in Panna, the claimant, Mrs. Kalpana Pathak, was living temporarily in Satna at the time of filing. Her son, one of the minor claimants, was studying in Satna, and she was residing there to care for him. Section 166(2) allows for filing where the claimant resides, which includes Satna."),
    ("Negligence and Fault in the Accident-Appellant‚Äôs Lawyer",
     "Your Honor, the deceased, Mr. Omkar Pathak, was driving the motorcycle, and my client, Mr. Namdeo, was merely the pillion passenger. It was the deceased's own negligence that led to the accident, not my client's actions. We urge the court to recognize that the responsibility lies solely with the deceased")
